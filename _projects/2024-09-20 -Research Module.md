## Network Security

During this module, We will discuss techniques that can be used to scan, evaluate and in some case mitigate network vulnerabilities. It also will consider the area of vulnerability assessments and explain the various mechanisms and approaches encapsulated in the Vulnerability Assessment Continuum.



Unit 1: History of Network Security, Vulnerabilities and Approaches:

In this unit, we will review the history of network security and vulnerabilities and relate it to the modern landscape. We will also discuss some security best practices and review the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011), which was based on a study of contemporary breach approaches.

Unit 2: Advanced Persistent Threats: Applying the Cyber Kill Chain Model to a Case Study

In this unit, we will revisit the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011) and apply it to a modern case study - the solar winds exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021) to explore if the well-known Cyber Kill Chain model is still as applicable for the analysis of modern Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

Unit 3: Vulnerability Assessments:

In this unit, we will review the different approaches to vulnerability assessments from paper-based processes such as Cyber Essentials, through a variety of vulnerability assessment approaches, to Crest-based and certified Penetration Tests. The lecturecast focuses on a general vulnerability assessment approach that can be used to create the basic audit document. This document should be used as the basis for more in-depth penetration tests.

Unit 4: Breach Analysis and Mitigation:

In this unit, we will use the techniques covered so far to review and evaluate security breaches and formulate responses to typical attacks. We will also review the suite of tools contained in the Kali Linux distribution that are focused on security assessments and testing.


Unit 5: Logging, Forensics and Future Trends:

In this unit, we will discuss two topics key to breach investigation and resolution: logging and forensics. We will look at the differences between logging on Windows and Linux systems and review key tools used in logging. We will also review the types of investigation that can be carried out using common forensic tools.

Unit 6: The Great Debate: The Future of the Internet

The final unit of this module. This week aims to bring together the various threads and lessons discussed in the module to answer the question: what is the future of the internet? In answering this question, you should consider technical and security considerations as well as social, legal and privacy challenges.
