description: In this module, we will examine the numerous overlaps and interactions between security and risk. We'll examine both qualitative and quantitative approaches to risk assessment. In addition to discussing a number of conventional risk models (such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees), we will also examine the growing trend toward hybrid models.

## Introduction

In the contemporary era of digitalization, there has been a swift and widespread integration of digital technologies, leading to a significant shift in organization operations from manual and labour-intensive procedures to automated and structured processes. The prominence of security and risk management has become paramount, exerting a significant influence on the operations of enterprises, governments, and individuals.
During my academic studies in the security and risk management module, I extensively examined multiple definitions of risk. Additionally, I employed numerous risk assessment approaches to evaluate, categorize, and mitigate risks within the context of projects and team discussions for the entirety of the module.
This reflective analysis aims to examine my understanding, individual development, and the consequences associated with security and risk management.


## Modules Overview

Throughout the team communication, I made a significant contribution by actively engaging in extended deliberations. I demonstrated my practical understanding regarding the substantial ramifications of the Industry 4.0 revolution and its revolutionary consequences on organizational operations. The adoption of business transformation techniques has proven to be advantageous. However, it is important to acknowledge that this implementation also increases the potential risks that organizations may encounter if they fail to adequately examine information security measures and legislation.
While progressing through module units, I have developed a solid understanding of the Risk Management Process (RMP). I can distinguish between the types of risk assessments and the role of user participation in the process. In my research on this topic, I examined every kind of assessment in depth. The qualitative risk assessment involves the evaluation of risks categorized as minimal, medium, or major. Furthermore, Quantitative assessments involve the utilization of statistical or historical data in order to evaluate and assign a numerical value to a risk (Qualitative vs. Quantitative Risk Assessment, 2021). Given the ease of implementation and adherence, qualitative risk assessment holds particular significance for organizations in their initial stages of risk assessment.
Consequently, it was imperative within this module to go further into quantitative assessment methodologies and expound upon several techniques of this nature. The subsequent discussion pertained to the investigation of threat modelling, which involved an evaluation of vulnerabilities, threat definitions, and various methodologies for threat modelling. Additionally, practical use cases of specific techniques such as STRIDE and DREAD were undertaken. Which significantly increased my understanding of employing diverse risk assessment methodologies to generate a comprehensive risk report for commercial purposes.
Within this module, an analysis has been conducted on a collection of widely recognized standards and frameworks pertaining to information security and data protection. These include the ISO 27000 series, NIST, GDPR, and COBIT. These standards establish cybersecurity best practices and recommend measures that are beneficial for enterprises to adopt. They also include regulations that assess an organization's efforts to safeguard customer data privacy. In cases of non-compliance, the government has the authority to impose fines on the corporation, leading to financial consequences for the organization.
Lastly, a comprehensive examination was conducted on the subject of Disaster Recovery (DR), with a subsequent analysis of the influence that Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) values have on the execution of DR strategies. Furthermore, acknowledges the significant role that information security plays in mitigating risks and enhancing the recovery process in the event of a security incident.


## Projects Reflections

The module's project was divided into two primary tasks, which demanded the submission of two reports on the Pampered Pets enterprise's digital and automated transformation. I was part of delivering the use case reports in collaboration with my group members. 
In the initial assignment, our team was tasked with preparing a report for a firm contemplating a business transformation by implementing an online e-commerce shop and integrating digital technologies to streamline its supply chain operations. This report serves as a practical exercise aimed at delivering a risk assessment report that focuses on analyzing and identifying business risks before transforming to digitalization. In this section, qualitative analysis was applied to emphasize the risks associated with the business. 
Furthermore, a comprehensive investigation of threat modelling was undertaken, employing two distinct methodologies: STRIDE and DREAD. The potential digitalization process was evaluated in compliance with ISO 27005 standards and utilizing threat modelling techniques. This particular encounter has had a profound impact on my understanding of these standards and their practical implementation. Integrating the STRIDE and DREAD threat modelling approaches has proven to be particularly valuable in evaluating prospective threats and assessing their associated risk scores. This integration allows for a comprehensive analysis of threats based on their types, enabling a more thorough understanding of the potential risks involved. The integration process has demonstrated its efficacy as a valuable means of acquiring knowledge and fostering personal growth in my experience.
As part of the module development, our team was tasked with another exercise to evaluate the company's decision to implement a digitalization transformation strategy. This assessment involved conducting a quantitative risk assessment using the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tool. The purpose of this tool was to evaluate various criteria in the decision-making process, identify risks, and prioritize them based on available information. Through a weighted assessment, we analyzed potential risks and determined their relative importance and ranking.
Furthermore, in the given scenario, the primary stakeholder involved in the company's transformation has expressed the need for a robust disaster recovery strategy that can effectively mitigate any disruptions to business operations, and ensure that downtime does not exceed one minute. Therefore, our team and I initially conducted research to identify the most optimal technologies and platforms that would facilitate the timely and cost-effective attainment of business objectives. So, by utilizing the cloud technologies that enable the exploration of their extensive potential, characterized by their ability to scale and incorporate built-in platforms that facilitate high availability and automatic scaling systems. These capabilities span across various regions, thereby facilitating the establishment of a robust infrastructure that supports online shopping with a high level of availability. This infrastructure aims to achieve a recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) of less than one minute.
Finally, I have conducted an analysis and engaged in discussions with the team regarding the prospective security trends and risks in light of recent advancements in technology, particularly the disruptive impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning on the overall industry. Additionally, we have examined how systems have played a more significant role in business deliberations. This inquiry pertains to the potential impact of a specific factor on cybersecurity risks, as well as the appropriate measures to address such risks.



## Summary

In summary, the security and risk management module has significantly influenced my understanding and cognitive approach towards risk assessment. This was achieved through engaging in discussions and actively implementing various risk assessments within practical scenarios. Additionally, the individual's contributions have facilitated the comprehension of novel technologies and methodologies for addressing the aforementioned hazards. This underscores the need to conduct early risk assessments for new projects and consistently undertake risk assessments throughout the business lifecycle, as it enables organizations to effectively pursue their objectives while minimizing disruptions.
