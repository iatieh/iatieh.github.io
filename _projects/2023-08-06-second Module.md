## Network Security

During this module, We will discuss techniques that can be used to scan, evaluate and in some case mitigate network vulnerabilities. It also will consider the area of vulnerability assessments and explain the various mechanisms and approaches encapsulated in the Vulnerability Assessment Continuum.



Unit 1: History of Network Security, Vulnerabilities and Approaches

In this unit, we will review the history of network security and vulnerabilities and relate it to the modern landscape. We will also discuss some security best practices and review the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011), which was based on a study of contemporary breach approaches.
