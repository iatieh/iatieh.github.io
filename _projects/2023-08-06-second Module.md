Unit 1 : Introduction to Cyber Security

In this unit, we discussed the importance of cybersecurity and the type of technologies impacted by cybersecurity threats, which focused on computer-based information, including types of networks, types of software, and databases in addition to the internet and the world wide web and how it works.

Subsequently, in every detail manner, we discussed the concepts of confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA):

Confidentiality
This security principle is concerned with controlled access to information. It is to ensure that access to sensitive information is accessible by the right person and not accessible by the wrong person.

 Availability
The availability principle guarantees reliability and uninterrupted access to sensitive data by authorised users.

Integrity
 The principle further ensures that the data's consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness should be maintained over its life cycle.


Lastly, understand the ethical and governance frameworks around information system security and data protection acts.
