## Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

Inferential statistics allows researchers to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It moves beyond descriptive statistics (which only summarize the data) to make conclusions that apply to a larger group. Hypothesis testing is a critical component of inferential statistics and involves evaluating assumptions about the population based on sample data.

Example of performing Hypothesis Testing: In hypothesis testing, we formulate two hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H₀), which states that there is no effect or difference, and the alternative hypothesis (H₁), which suggests a significant impact or difference. For example, suppose a researcher wants to test whether a new cybersecurity awareness program has improved employees' security behaviour. The null hypothesis could state, "The new program does not affect employees' behaviour," the alternative hypothesis might be, "The program improves behaviour." After gathering data (e.g., comparing security behavior metrics before and after the program), the researcher conducts a t-test or another appropriate statistical test to determine if the observed difference is statistically significant.
Key Concepts:

- P-value: The probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A p-value less than 0.05 is often considered statistically significant.
- Confidence Intervals: A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., mean) with a certain level of confidence (typically 95%).
