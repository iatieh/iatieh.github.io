## Digitalization Risk Assessment - Executive Summary

# Executive Summary

### Introduction

“In the context of cyber security, risk is present where a threat intersects with a corresponding vulnerability which allows it to manifest”

### Quantitative Risk Assessment of Pampered Pets Digitalisation and Supply Chain Expansion. 

Quantitative risk assessment is a probabilistic tool to identify possible hazard or threat by using graph-based method supported by mathematical models (Cherdansteva et al, 2016). The purpose of this method is to provide a clear, numerical evaluation of risks, making it easier to understand and address potential issues in the supply chain and digital expansion of Pampered Pets. This section of the report will quantitatively assess Pampered Pets digitisation and supply chain expansion. Quantitative risk assessment can be used to identify risk in quality, supply chain and legal aspects of the business; providing a structured evaluation and mitigation of potential issues and better understanding of how risks within these domains are interdependent (REF)

2.1.	Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a widely adopted tool to evaluate multiple criteria when making decisions to identify risk and sort them according to available information (Getzner, 2005, p.99). In the context of Pampered Pets digitalisation and expansion, Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis can be used to analyse the problem and extract the critical risk that can affect the decision based on their impact and likelihood (Rokou, 2014, P.3). 

2.2.	Detailed Assumption list and Calculation
With regards to the digitalisation and supply chain Pampered Pets expansion, we can extract number of potential risks from quality risks, supply chain risk and Legal risk. These extracted potential risks include, technology integration risk, data security breaches, supplier and vendor issues, technological failures, logistical delays, data security challenges and regulatory compliance.
Quality risk: Technology Integration issues may lead to quality problems if not implemented properly. Data security breaches may compromise on product quality if the machines are hackeda or altered. Supplier and vender issues can affect the quality of material and components if disrupted. 
Supply chain risk: Technological failure and breakdowns may occur when using automated warehouses and internal supply chain. Automated systems can encounter errors which can cause logistical delays. Data security breaches in the supply chain can cause the loss of data and unauthorised access to the system. 
Legal risk: Failure to comply with government regulatory compliance regarding GDPR and Digital supply chain regulations may lead to disruptions in the supply chain and Legal issues.

2.2.2	Results and Risk Ranking
Based on the weighted Assessment we can prioritise and rank the risk according to most critical risk to the least critical risk that can help in the decision making (Arun, 2023. p10). The highest weighted risk is data security breaches with a score of 25 followed by data security risks with a score of 20.  'Technological failures' and 'Technology Integration' are also significant areas of concern, with scores of 16 and 12 respectively. Logistical delays equally has a score of 12 indicating potential inefficiencies in the supply chain which could impact the operations of Pampered Pets. Also, Supplier and vendor risks, has a score of 9, which draws attention to potential challenges with external stakeholders. Finally, the lowest scoring domain was legal with regulatory compliance having a score of 6, though this is still an area to be cautious about as non-compliance could cause further legal issues.

3.	Summary of Results and Recommendations 
Quality Risk: The main concerns within the quality domain revolve around the effective integration of technology and the potential risks posed by data breaches, which are two points that scored highly in the assessment. Should the digital infrastructure fail to be seamlessly integrated, operational inefficiencies may occur, which compromises quality, especially in the case of a cyber security attack and systems are breached. Therefore, the main recommendation would be to invest in technology integration platforms that would facilitate the seamless integration into digitalisation for Pampered Pets. However, there should be a focus on secure features with regular audits of systems to ensure vulnerabilities to breaches do not exist. 
Supply Chain Risk: As the results demonstrate, technological failures were a significant area for concern. It must be taken into consideration that Pampered Pets now has an internal supply chain and a number of automated warehouses worldwide. Thus, with this new development, the risk of technological failures in automated systems can lead to significant supply chain disruptions. Such failures can result in logistical delays, which hinders the timely delivery of products or services of the business. As a recommendation, it is imperative to develop a contingency plan for technological failures which may lead to damaging disruptions. For instance, this could include having backup systems in the case of hardware or software technological issues. Alongside this, in emergency cases, hybrid working environment could be put in place in which manual processes are used to support the automated warehouse; this would mitigate the impact of the overall risks of both technological failures and logistical delays. 
Moreover, to address any data security risks, which scored highly in the results, regular vulnerability assessments could be conducted to identify any new potential risks to the supply chain and the business. Also, having an incident Response plan in place would be an effective tool in the event of a security breach with could potentially limit the level of damage.
Legal Risk: Regulatory compliance and GDRP


### Disaster recovery Solution and platform Recommendation 

The objective of the business is to digitize the business operations and introduce online shopping in order to expand the customer base and enhance the network of business suppliers. It is crucial to develop a business continuity strategy that incorporates a disaster recovery plan to meet the stringent recovery point objective (RPO) of less than one minute and recovery time objective (RTO) of less than one minute, as per the business requirements.
Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) have become crucial for organizations of all sizes as they embark on the process of digitizing their operations. The primary objective of the corporate Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) function is to mitigate the impact of disruptions and interruptions on corporate operations while also minimizing the potential risks associated with data loss and reputational damage (Moore, Bigelow and Crocetti, 2022).
The concept of business continuity pertains to the preservation and prompt restoration of corporate operations in the face of significant disruptions, such as those arising from fires, floods, or cyberattacks perpetrated by hostile individuals. A business continuity plan delineates the protocols and directives that a firm must adhere to in the event of such calamities. It encompasses various aspects, including business operations, resources, personnel, and external collaborators. (Lindros, 2023).
Disaster recovery refers to the strategic measures implemented by a corporate organization to efficiently manage and minimize the impacts of an unexpected event, with the primary goal of promptly returning operations to a secure and stable condition.(Jo, 2022). The disaster recovery plan ensures that the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are established and validated through testing. The business's Recovery Time Objective (RTO) refers to the duration within which it can withstand a disruption to its regular activities. The term "Recovery Point Objective" (RPO) pertains to the amount of data that an organization can tolerate losing, typically quantified in terms of time.

Business continuity and disaster recovery possess distinct objectives. Successful business continuity plans aim to minimize operational downtime, whereas successful disaster recovery plans aim to mitigate anomalous or inefficient system functions. Businesses may effectively prepare for significant disasters only with the integration of both plans. (Jo, 2022)
The pursuit of attaining a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than one minute, as specified by Ms O'dour, is a challenging endeavor that needs a sophisticated and meticulously designed infrastructure. Nevertheless, the feasibility of this endeavor has been made possible by utilizing the advancement of cloud services and technologies like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure.
Therefore, utilising cloud technologies would facilitate a more streamlined, cost-efficient, and time-effective process compared to constructing a system using on-premise architecture. In an on-premise structure, the company is required to establish many data centers in different countries or regions while also procuring an extensive amount of software and hardware components. This results in a significant increase in expenses.
The objective is to construct an online system that utilizes a highly available architecture by leveraging the AWS services shown in figure 1. This involves activating all components across many geographic regions, each with multiple availability zones (AZs) inside the region. AZs refer to unique geographical places that have been intentionally designed to be protected from potential failures occurring in other AZs. (Jayendrapatil, 2022).

Figure No.1: AWS Disaster Recovery Architecture

By implementing a multi-region active-active architecture. In order to guarantee efficient application distribution across several regions, it is crucial to utilize the AWS global accelerator service for optimal traffic control across a variety of data centers. This service enables the efficient distribution of network traffic to the geographically closest region. To enhance the speed of the recovery process, The architecture of the application structure will include the integration of several availability zones within a specified region, as well as across diverse regions. The Amazon Route 53 service is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that functions as a Domain Name System (DNS). It is designed to efficiently handle a large number of DNS queries and offers various advanced traffic management features. These features include Latency-Based Routing, Weighted Routing, Geolocation Routing, and Failover Routing, all of which are compatible with the multi-region architecture. (How to consider Store System’s Disaster Recovery Architecture with AWS | Amazon Web Services, 2023)
The second component is the utilization of AWS Aurora Global Database, which is a distributed database system designed to facilitate real-time replication across several regions. This system guarantees the continuous replication of data across all regions, hence ensuring data consistency and availability.
Once the data's high availability is confirmed, the implementation of a stateless application design will be carried out via the managed Kubernetes service offered by Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters that span several Availability Zones (AZs) in order to enhance fault tolerance. In the event of an availability zone (AZ) failure, the cluster is able to sustain its operations by leveraging the remaining AZs, thereby mitigating the consequences of the failure. EKS leverages the AWS Auto Scaling Groups service to autonomously replace nodes that have failed or are in an unhealthy state, hence guaranteeing the continuous availability of applications.
However, to execute a successful disaster recovery procedure immediately once any failure happens, three components are essential to be activated as follows
1.	Automation of Disaster Recovery: - Employ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions such as AWS Cloud Formation or Terraform for implementation. This enables the speedy reconstruction of the entire infrastructure. Utilize automated recovery options. One example of automation in cloud computing involves the utilization of AWS Lambda, which may be activated in response to specific CloudWatch alarms, thereby facilitating the automated execution of recovery procedures.
2.	Regular Monitoring and Alerting: - Utilize cloud-native monitoring solutions such as Amazon CloudWatch.Establish notifications for any deviations or malfunctions inside the system that can be sent to AWS Lambda.
3.	Evaluation of Disaster Recovery Processes: - It is imperative to conduct regular testing of disaster recovery processes in order to verify their functionality and effectiveness. The practice of Chaos Engineering can be effectively executed by utilizing tools such as Gremlin or the Chaos Monkey in conjunction with Spring Boot. These tools enable the deliberate introduction of faults into a system, hence facilitating the testing of its resilience.
 
### Vendor lock-in

When a company makes the decision to rely on the infrastructure, tools, and services provided by a certain cloud service provider. The presence of advantages and disadvantages in a given situation is contingent upon the operational model and aims of each individual organization. Selecting a single cloud provider poses challenges and expenses when transitioning to an alternative provider, as well as the potential for price hikes by vendors who are aware of the difficulties faced by clients who are locked into their services. However, simultaneously utilizing a single cloud provider would result in a reduction in complexity, as the provider's integrated system would facilitate the process and make it more convenient to develop team skills and support capabilities for a specific type of technology.


### Summary 

It is important to note that the attainment of a one-minute Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) necessitates not only the appropriate technological infrastructure but also clearly defined operational procedures, comprehensive training, and periodic testing. The previously mentioned design delineates a particular technique utilizing AWS cloud architecture.
