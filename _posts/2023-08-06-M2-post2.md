## Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Results and Executive Summary

 Implementing the highest level of cybersecurity standards and technologies is essential to protect the online shopping system that LUMA uses as an e-commerce website to sell its activewear to its online customers. According to the NIST framework, the first stage to protect any system starts with identifying asset or application vulnerabilities, internal and external threats, and potential risks (What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework? | Balbix, 2022). Consequently, we are going to conduct a vulnerability assessment for the LUMA company web application using different methodologies and techniques to evaluate the system's confidentiality, integrity and availability. Accordingly, we used a set of open-source tools part of Debian-based Linux known as Kali Linux that provide penetration testing and security auditing capabilities to perform this assessment.
In assessing the website security posture, we have followed several methodologies that are commonly used to provide indicators about the system security posture and detailed vulnerabilities as follows:
1.	Performing Threat modeling assessment using the STRIDE framework to identify potential threats that would cause security risks. This framework was developed in the late 1990s by two Microsoft engineers to address new security threats to the systems caused by advanced technologies and how to map the potential threats with the newly developed system in the design phase; STRIDE framework consists of six threats categories, including spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, the elevation of privilege (Hewko, 2023). 

2.	Social engineering is a method used by attackers which typically involves some psychological manipulation leading users to share confidential or sensitive data by clicking on a malicious URL or opening malicious files, which usually happens by sending emails or another way of communication that appears to be coming from a trusted source (What Are Social Engineering Attacks? (Types & Definition), no date). Hence, we have targeted customers of the LUMA website with an email that appears to be coming from website technical support to confirm their authentication by clicking on a malicious link to steal their website credentials.

3.	Vulnerability Scanning involves using automated tools to scan the website to identify technologies used and their vulnerabilities, highlight outdated software, figure out the misconfiguration, identifies flaws and weak entry points into the system throughout the different periods, which could be used to perform security attacks (Fernandez, 2023). Using vulnerability scanners tried to attack the LUMA website, performed a remote assessment using the active scanning method by actively probing and interacting with the website using various tools and techniques to attack the targeted website. Although active scanning could cause system distribution and comes with many false positives, but it covers many technical aspects while assessing any system to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Therefore, We started the Linux Kali operating system that, specifically designed for penetration testing and security assessment, comes with various vulnerability scanning tools, such as OWASP ZAP, Nessus, and OpenVAS. Accordingly, we initiated the website assessment by using the OWASP ZAP tool by running a set of functionality, starting with the spider that navigates through a target web application, discovering and categorizing all accessible pages, which helps to ensure the security assessment is performed for all the website pages and not limited to the main ones. Once the spider tool completes the crawling process, we will initiate the active scanning to identify vulnerabilities in the discovered pages in the website and present their page on their impact severity. Lastly, we begin the fuzzer tool that provides invalid random inputs to an application to discover crashes or unexpected behaviours. Figure 1 presents the OAWSP ZAP tool while running the crawling process to load the other tools with website details to execute the active scanning and Fuzzing.
