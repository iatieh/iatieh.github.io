## e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review

The mixed-methods approach described in this week's readings would be the most suitable for my research project investigating cybersecurity threats in cloud service for the retail industry. This approach effectively combines quantitative and qualitative data, using secondary and primary data collection to investigate cybersecurity threats to consumer data in cloud-based services comprehensively. It allows me to capture both the statistical prevalence of threats and the insights of experts on mitigation strategies. Given the complexity of cybersecurity in cloud environments, understanding the frequency of attacks and expert perspectives on addressing them is essential.

For data collection, I would employ semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews with cybersecurity professionals and IT experts would provide qualitative insights, allowing me to explore the nuances of emerging threats and mitigation techniques that might not surface in surveys alone.

The quantitative component of secondary data analysis uses available datasets, reports, and industry surveys to analyze trends and statistics related to cybersecurity threats and risks in cloud services for the retail industry. This can provide a broad understanding of the frequency and types of threats and common mitigation strategies.

To execute this project, I need to develop several skills. First, I must gain knowledge in designing and distributing surveys that ensure high response rates and reliable data. Additionally, I need strong interviewing skills to gather meaningful and insightful information during expert interviews. Data analysis skills will also be critical, particularly in statistical analysis for survey data and thematic analysis for interview transcripts. Lastly, a solid understanding of cloud technologies and cybersecurity frameworks is essential to frame the questions and interpret the data in context correctly. Developing these skills will ensure that my research produces valuable, actionable insights.
