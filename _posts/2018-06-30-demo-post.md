## Summary of the first colloborative activity

Summarising the overall peers' posts, everyone agreed on the worldwide impact of cybersecurity and how cybersecurity has become a global challenge. At the same time, all industries are under the cybersecurity risks and bad actors’ threats in all regions. I have learned about new cybersecurity incidents I had never heard about that gave better ideas on recent data breaches' causes and impact on people and organisations.

Blessing's posts remind me of the WannaCry ransomware; this was the first ransomware attack that got the attention of many organisations. And it was a perfect example that a cyberattack would target any industry, including health care. For example, Britain's National Health Services (NHS) was one of the most impacted organization by this attack. And from here, every organisation started questioning their readiness for such an attack and whether they had the right backup tools and processes to recover in case their data got encrypted with Ransomware.

Megan's posts gave a significant example of a cybersecurity attack targeting vulnerable third-party tools like SolarWinds, which many companies use to monitor their IT infrastructure and automate IT processes. The SolarWinds attack confirmed the need to implement ongoing third-party risk assessment by evaluating their information security best practices. 

By reading Anja's post, we must consider another type of attack that targets humans using phishing techniques to steal users' credentials and take advantage of human limited knowledge in cybersecurity risk and sharing personal credentials with someone they don't know and should not trust. 

Finally, in the era where companies need to communicate with each other’s, using different technologies from LAN for internal communication, WAN to communicate in a more extensive range, access Websites, sending and receive emails, all these ways of communication made cybersecurity the major challenge for every organisation to avoid getting breached due to someone gets inside the network and steal the personal data of the customers of each company. It was important for the governments to start formalising the regulation and laws that force the companies to consider all cybersecurity measures to protect their customers' data.  And one of the most important regulations is GDPR, where the Europe union put standards that companies should follow to respond to the adoption of cloud services and the increase in data breaches (Wolford, 2022).
