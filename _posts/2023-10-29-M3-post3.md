## Industry 4.0 Revolution 

In this research, the authors explained the Industry 4.0 revolution and its impact on the company's business processes, people's way of working, 
and how to use emerging technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and analytics. Also, 
integrating technologies like AI and machine learning into their operations. These technologies increase automation, 
optimise business processes and add a high level of efficiency and responsiveness to customers' needs, which was impossible in the old way of working (What is Industry 4.0 and how does it work? | IBM, no date)

However, the rapid increase in adopting these technologies as part of the Industry 4.0 revolution increases the attack surface and adds more pressure on the cybersecurity methods to protect the company's data, 
which brings additional risks to the new business models. In contrast, this research determined the risks that appear due to the rapid digitalisation transformation as part of the latest technology adoption. 
Although, as mentioned by the author of this research, there are several ways to assess the risk coming with the adoption of these technologies, 
he found that rarely companies evaluate the change in the business model by implementing new technologies to avoid financial loss by adopting new business models.

The wide adoption of IoT devices comes with a set of technical risks, and using IoT technologies as part of the business operation requires connecting to the network and sharing data with different systems using the internet. 
This increases the attack surface toward any company and makes it difficult to protect, especially if these IoT devices have many vulnerabilities that are not easy to fix. ((The wide adoption of IoT technology is creating additional risks for users, 2022).

Using cloud services would come with data security risks and make the possibility of being impacted by data breaches and data loss higher, 
and this is mainly because not all cloud providers are equipped to deal with these risks. (Pinson-Roxburgh, 2022).

According to the research (Sandner, 2018), companies adopting new technologies that increase productivity come with additional risks to these companies. Hence, they must balance technology transformation in business, security, and data privacy.
