## End of Module Assignment: Module Reflection 

Throughout my study of the "Research Methods and Professional Practice" module, I gained a deep understanding of research principles. I practiced the knowledge I learned using different exercises while moving through the module units. Using Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reflective model—What? So what? Now what?—I will explore the module's impact on my professional skills and emotional responses and how this learning has influenced my actions and decisions. The course allowed me to map my strengths and weaknesses using a SWOT analysis, develop an action plan, and reflect on how my skills have evolved.
A significant learning area was the Introduction to research methods, where I explored the principles of scientific investigation and ethics. This had a profound impact on both my academic and professional mindset. Ethical decision-making is essential in my role as a CyberSecurity professional. The module reinforced the importance of ethics in research, particularly regarding data privacy and security, which is closely aligned with my professional responsibilities. I realized that ethical principles must underpin all my research activities, especially when dealing with sensitive information. This learning has already influenced my approach to decision-making at work, where I now emphasise ensuring cybersecurity measures comply with ethical standards.
One of the most beneficial components of the module was learning how to formulate research questions, conduct literature reviews, and draft a comprehensive research proposal. Creswell (2014) emphasizes that well-formulated research questions are essential for framing the direction of any study. These steps provided me with a structured approach to conducting academic research. I now understand that well-crafted research questions are the cornerstone of any successful research project, guiding the direction of inquiry. In cybersecurity, asking the right questions is essential for identifying gaps in knowledge and focusing on the most critical issues (Saunders et al., 2019). During the module, I developed research questions for my literature review project on cybersecurity vulnerabilities in IoT devices in the retail sector, which helped me sharpen my study’s focus. Similarly, the literature review allowed me to identify existing research, assess its relevance, and build upon it to formulate my proposal. 
The module also highlighted the difference between methodology and research methods, an area I had previously needed clarification on. Understanding that methodology refers to the theoretical framework, research methods, and practical tools used for data collection allowed me to be more deliberate in designing research projects. As a cybersecurity professional, I must often investigate user behaviour and system interactions. The module gave me the skills to select appropriate qualitative methods for exploratory research. Recently, I applied this knowledge to a case study on cybersecurity awareness within an organization, using focus groups to gather in-depth insights from employees. 
Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design were also covered in depth. These tools are essential for gathering primary data in research and professional practice. During the module, I learned how to design effective questionnaires and conduct structured interviews. The skills I developed in this area have strengthened my ability to design surveys that provide reliable data, which is a skill I will continue to use in future research and professional projects.
Quantitative methods were another area where I saw significant growth. The module’s focus on Descriptive and Inferential Statistics enabled me to analyze large datasets, identify trends, and draw conclusions based on data. Initially, I found the statistical concepts challenging, but I became more comfortable with tools like hypothesis testing through practice. 
Moreover, the module’s emphasis on Data Analysis and Visualization taught me how to present complex data clearly and visually engagingly. As a cybersecurity professional, I often need to present security data to non-technical stakeholders, and the ability to visualise data effectively is crucial for ensuring understanding and informed decision-making. Since completing this module, I have improved how I present data in professional reports, making it more accessible to a wider audience. For instance, I recently used visualizations to illustrate the results of an application vulnerability assessment, making the findings more understandable to senior management.
Validity and Generalisability were also critical concepts covered in the module. Ensuring the validity of research means that it accurately measures what it intends to do, which is essential for producing credible results. Generalisability, the extent to which findings can be applied to other contexts, is particularly relevant in cybersecurity research, where results from one system might not always apply to others (Cohen et al., 2017). Understanding these concepts helped me design more robust research protocols, ensuring my findings are valid while being cautious about overgeneralizing results. 

As part of my practical activities in units 7, 8, and 9, I practiced solving exercises in a provided worksheet. For instance, building a table that shows the frequencies and percentage frequencies of the variable Brand in the Area 2 respondents using Microsoft Excel format. I could interpret the findings and the patterns of brand preferences in each demographic area, as shown in the table and chart below.

The module helped me improve my ability to present research proposals while submitting the module assignment. I have applied these skills to prepare detailed reports and presentations for cybersecurity initiatives within my organization.
As part of this module, I completed a Professional Skills Matrix. Where I conducted a SWOT Analysis to assess my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to my research and professional development. The matrix revealed that I had strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which were beneficial for the technical aspects of cybersecurity research. However, I identified areas for improvement, such as academic writing and the systematic design of research methodologies. This insight helped me create an action plan to enhance these skills throughout the course.
My journey through the module was marked by both excitement and occasional frustration. At times, the complex concepts—especially those related to statistical analysis—felt overwhelming. However, as I progressed through the material, my confidence grew. Mastering complex topics like Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing became rewarding, and I felt a sense of accomplishment when I could apply these skills both academically and professionally. Emotional responses like these are common when facing challenges in learning, and they are essential to professional growth (Braun and Clarke, 2006). The challenge was emotional but also sparked a sense of resilience, teaching me to embrace complexity rather than shy away from it.
Overall, this module has significantly impacted my personal and professional development. The skills and knowledge I gained have not only improved my academic research capabilities but have also been directly applied to my role as a cybersecurity professional. Through this reflection, I have recognized the importance of integrating ethical principles, research design, and data analysis into academic and professional projects. The learning from this module will continue to shape my future research, mainly as I further investigate cybersecurity threats. This course's combination of practical tools and theoretical insights has prepared me to approach research and professional challenges confidently and rigorously.
