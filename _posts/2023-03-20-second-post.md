## Summary of Collaborative Learning Discussion 2

 Going over the posts by my peers in collaborative discussion 2 on network and software security allowed me to understand several technologies that would help protect an organisation's network and software by applying necessary controls to avoid software compromise.

While considering network and software security, it is obvious that both complete each other to make sure the organisation's application is secured from external and internal attacks, which makes the defence in depth strategy essential that the company has to follow by applying a layer protection approach to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of the company data.

The defense in depth model prevents data breaches. It stops unauthenticated attempts to access the company's data by implementing 7 layers of protection and validation, which means even if one of the layers is compromised, there would be another 6 layers of defense (GeeksforGeeks, 2021).

An effective defense in depth strategy should cover both network and software security considering the following :

     1. Firewall: there are two types of firewalls, one controls traffic through access policies and ensures only allowed protocols and whitelisted sources and destinations can pass through it. The second one is known as a web application firewall (WAF) that prevents malicious activity directed to a specific application like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack (Cybersecurity Spotlight - Defense in Depth (DiD), 2021b).
     2. Identity Access Management: where identity becomes the new perimeter, applying several techniques, starting from the least privileged access approach that provides access to the users to what they need based on their job role. And considering multi-factor authentication (MFA) that verifies the identity of the users using multiple authentication methods. Apply behavioural analysis that detects abnormal traffic patterns and stop them. Finally, the Zero Trust approach assumes no user, device, or connection should be allowed by default (cloudflare., no date).
     3. Software security: Starts from the threat modelling approach during the design phase to the code review as part of the static code analysis, penetration testing and lastly, vulnerability scanning.  where all ensure the security level before launching the application.

In Conclusion, cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated and diverse, targeting all levels of IT infrastructure and application; the cybersecurity community has to apply the same level of security to all layers involved in provided technologies considering the development happening on the attack methods.
