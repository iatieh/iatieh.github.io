## Reflection on Data Misuse Through Online Surveys: The Case of Cambridge Analytica

The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 highlighted how seemingly innocuous surveys on platforms like Facebook were used for exploitative purposes. These surveys collected personal data without user consent and were later monetised for political gains. Cambridge Analytica obtained data from millions of Facebook users who had unknowingly participated in simple quizzes. This data was subsequently used for micro-targeted political advertisements during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, influencing the democratic process in ways users had not anticipated (Confessore, 2018).

### Ethical Considerations
The main ethical issue in this case is the lack of informed consent. While users engaged voluntarily with the surveys, they were unaware that their data and friends' data were being collected and shared for political purposes. This represents a breach of trust and a violation of user privacy. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook bypassed informed consent by needing to be more transparent about how data would be used beyond the immediate interaction with the survey (Confessore, 2018).

Another example of the inappropriate use of surveys occurred in Facebook’s data-sharing practices with companies like Microsoft and Spotify. According to Dance, LaForgia and Confessore (2018), Facebook shared user data with these companies without proper consent, even allowing them access to users’ private messages. This highlights the ethical challenges of data-sharing partnerships and the potential for misuse of personal information.

### Social Impact
The social impact of these data breaches has been significant. Public trust in social media platforms, especially Facebook, has eroded. Users were outraged to learn that their personal data had been mishandled, leading to movements like #DeleteFacebook, where people protested against the platform’s unethical practices. This scandal also prompted a broader discussion about privacy in the digital age, as users became increasingly aware of how their data was being harvested and exploited (Dance, LaForgia and Confessore, 2018).
Similarly, Facebook's data-sharing agreements with tech giants like Microsoft and Netflix caused users to question the level of control they had over their personal information. This further fuelled scepticism about the transparency of online platforms and how they handle user data (Dance, LaForgia and Confessore, 2018).

### Legal Implications
The Cambridge Analytica case had significant legal repercussions. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined Facebook $5 billion for failing to protect its users' privacy, highlighting the importance of more robust regulatory frameworks (Confessore, 2018). Shortly after the scandal, introducing the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provided stricter guidelines on obtaining consent and protecting user data.
Facebook’s broader data-sharing practices also raised legal concerns. Its failure to secure proper consent for sharing data with companies like Microsoft and Netflix may have breached its 2011 consent agreement with the FTC, which required explicit user permission for data sharing (Dance, LaForgia and Confessore, 2018).

### Professional Responsibility
From a professional standpoint, these cases highlight the importance of ethical responsibility in handling personal data. Data professionals, developers, and corporate leaders must ensure that personal data is managed transparently and ethically. The Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook’s broader data-sharing agreements underline the necessity for ethical decision-making in data handling. Prioritising user privacy is not only a legal requirement but a professional obligation, and companies must be held accountable for any misuse of personal information (Dance, LaForgia and Confessore, 2018).

### Conclusion
Cambridge Analytica’s and Facebook’s data-sharing agreements' inappropriate use of surveys demonstrates the ethical, social, legal, and professional challenges surrounding data misuse. These cases emphasise the need for robust privacy protections and stronger regulations to prevent the exploitation of user data. Moving forward, companies must adopt ethical practices and transparency in data collection to restore public trust and ensure that personal information is treated with respect and care.
