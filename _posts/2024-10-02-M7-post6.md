## Validity and Generalisability in Research

Validity refers to how accurately a study measures what it intends to measure. At the same time, generalisability concerns the extent to which a study's results can be applied to broader populations or different contexts. High validity ensures the findings reflect reality, whereas high generalisability suggests the results are applicable beyond the specific sample or environment.
Example of Ensuring Validity and Generalisability: A cybersecurity study examining consumer data protection in retail might aim for high internal validity by carefully controlling variables, such as ensuring that only data from companies with a specific cybersecurity framework is analyzed. To achieve external validity (and thus generalisability), the sample of companies should be diverse in size, geographical location, and customer base.

For example, if the study only includes large multinational retailers, it may not be generalizable to small, local shops. To increase generalisability, the researcher could sample retailers of varying sizes from different industries, ensuring that the findings reflect the broader population of retail companies.

Types of Validity:
•	Internal Validity: The degree to which the results can be attributed to the variables tested rather than other factors.
•	External Validity: The extent to which the results can be generalized to other contexts, populations, or settings.
