## Data Analysis and Visualization

Data analysis involves processing, cleaning, and examining datasets to extract meaningful insights. Visualization complements data analysis by presenting findings in an intuitive, visual format, helping identify patterns, trends, and outliers. Effective visualizations can enhance understanding, communicate results more clearly, and support decision-making.
Example of Data Analysis and Visualization: A researcher collecting data on IoT devices in retail might first clean the data (e.g., handling missing values), calculate key metrics (e.g., number of security breaches per device), and conduct exploratory analysis. For example, they may analyze how the frequency of security breaches correlates with the type of IoT device or vendor. Visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, or scatter plots can illustrate this relationship. A bar chart might show the number of breaches by device type. At the same time, a scatter plot can visualize any correlation between the number of IoT devices in a store and the likelihood of a security incident.
Tools:

- Excel or Google Sheets: For basic data visualization (e.g., pie charts, histograms).
- Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) or R (ggplot2): For more complex data analysis and visualizations.
