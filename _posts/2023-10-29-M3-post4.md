## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a public framework published and maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) that is mainly used for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities for all types of software products like operating systems, databases, and web applications. (Gillis and Bacon, 2023).

According to the research (Spring et al., 2021), The use of the CVSS scoring system for risk assessment is discouraged due to the absence of rationale and the unreliable output generated by the CVSS algorithm as a result of the lack of openness regarding the derivation methodologies of the formula. While the CVSS v3.0 provides improved transparency regarding the formulation method, it should be noted that the CVSS equation was originally created using expert data without explicitly elaborating on the ranking procedure.

I agree entirely with the perspective put forth by the researchers regarding inadequacy and insufficiency. I propose the implementation of risk scoring through the computation of the Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) for assessing risk and urgency. This approach takes into account the degree of exploitation and allows for the dynamic adjustment of VPR to accurately reflect the prevailing threat landscape.
