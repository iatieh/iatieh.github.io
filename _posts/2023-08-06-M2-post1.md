## Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Baseline Analysis and Plan

 Online shopping systems greatly benefit retailers as they help them reach more customers much faster, which usually positively impacts the company's revenues. In contrast, it comes with several types of vulnerabilities, whereas identifying them and their risks is the first step to avoiding cybersecurity threats. As part of this analysis document, we will evaluate e-commerce websites for a UK-based company named Luma; Luma is a nationally recognised active wear manufacturer and retailer with more than 230 stores distributed across 43 states and keeps growing.

Several vulnerabilities might impact online shopping systems, some of which would cost direct revenue loss. According to the research (Varghese, 2022), the e-commerce industry experience up to 32.4% of successful attacks annually, exploiting known vulnerabilities of e-commerce such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer-flow. (Endpoint Protection - Symantec Enterprise, no date). SQL injection allows the hacker to access the backend database using a malicious technique to collect the data stored in this database, wipe the data, or corrupt the database. (Varghese, 2022). Cross-site scripting (XSS) allow the attacker to place JavaScript on the e-commerce to target online visitors and customers, which grants the hacker access to the customer's computers. Moreover, the buffer flow would allow the hacker to send a large number of data to web applications that they cannot deal with and might cause the system to crash (Endpoint Protection - Symantec Enterprise, no date).
Vulnerabilities assessment tools are many. However, the following are some of the well-known tools:

•	Grabber
•	SQLMap
•	Nmap

All the above tools are freely available and can be used without commercial restrictions. Hence they are widely used, and many videos and learning sessions are available online. Grabber is one of the application scanner tools that detect security vulnerabilities in web applications like cross-site scripting, and preferable since it is easy to use and portable. Another tool SQLMap, helps to find the SQL injection vulnerabilities in the web application database using automated processes. It is also easy to use and has a powerful detection engine(Shankdhar, 2021). The last tool is Nmap, the most popular open-source tool used for network exploration; it can scan large networks rapidly, and because it is an open-source platform, many scripts are developed that can help to perform different types of vulnerability scans.

Although vulnerability scanner tools help identify exploitable security issues, they might impact the website's operations and contribute to reducing the system's safety and security if not used correctly (Singh, 2021). Moreover, vulnerability testing can be done using non-invasive testing, which less impacts the targeted system. Second, invasive testing performs more sophisticated scanning and runs real attack simulations that may expose the website to hackers. We can see this in SQL-injection and cross-site scripting attacks where it will inject fake data into the database to confirm vulnerability, but that would lead to creating posts in the web application that actual hackers use later to leak confidential data from a database or expose the web application to perform further attacks on the web application users. (Singh, 2021).

On the other hand, vulnerability scanner tools have their limitation, and this is mainly because most of them are open-source tools published online on public repositories, and the most signification limitation it comes the limited list of vulnerabilities available in their database, which will not be able to detect unknown vulnerabilities that are not part of the tool stored list. Other limitations are a high rate of false positive reported vulnerability, deeper issues might not be detected, required a lot of effort and time from the team to execute and ensure its effectiveness. Hence, automated and continuous scanning is essential to ensure the identified vulnerabilities include the recently announced vulnerabilities. 

Accordingly, the Luma e-commerce online system comes with several risks and expected vulnerabilities that have to be constantly monitored and mitigated immediately to avoid any impacts that would cause financial or reputation damage to the organisation. Therefore, using vulnerability tools is essential to provide a comprehensive view of the company's e-commerce system security posture.
